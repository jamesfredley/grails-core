## grails-web-databinding

This subproject includes a lot of code to support data binding.

The [GrailsWebDataBinder](src/main/groovy/grails/web/databinding/WebDataBinding.groovy) 
class extends [SimpleDataBinder](../grails-databinding-core/src/main/groovy/grails/databinding/SimpleDataBinder.groovy) from
the [grails-databinding](../grails-databinding) subproject and adds to it a lot of Grails specific behavior like
special handling of GORM entities, code specifically relevant to binding web requests to objects and other behaviors.

The [WebDataBinding](src/main/groovy/grails/web/databinding/WebDataBinding.groovy) trait adds special methods
which support special binding usage patterns like `someObj.properties = request`.
