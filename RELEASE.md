# Apache Grails Release Process

This document outlines the steps to release a new version of Apache Grails. It is important to follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth release process. The release process can be divided into 4 stages across 2 repositories: `grails-core` & `grails-forge`.

## Prerequisites

Prior to starting the release process, ensure that any other dependent library is set to a non-snapshot version in `dependencies.gradle`. Per the [Apache Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html), all dependencies must be official releases and cannot be snapshots. The build will fail if any snapshot dependencies are present.

## 1. Staging 

During the staging step, we must create a source distribution & stage any binary artifacts that end users will consume - including the grails-cli & grails-forge-cli located in the grails-forge repository.
1. Create a release in `grails-core`:
   * Click "Draft a new release" here: https://github.com/apache/grails-core/releases
   * On the draft new release screen, we execute the following steps:
     * The tag will have the prefix 'v', so for our release it would be 'v7.0.0-M4'
     * The "Target" will be the branch we build out of (this case it's the default, 7.0.x)
     * Previous tag will be auto
     * Click "Generate Release Notes"
       * This will then scan our commit history and we adjust the release notes per project agreement.
     * Check "pre-release"
     * Click "Publish Release"
2. (grails-core) The Github workflow from `release.yml`, titled `Release - Create grails-core`, will kick off.  The `publish` job will:
   * checkout the project
   * setup gradle
   * extract the version # from the tag
   * run the pre-release workflow (updates gradle.properties to be the version specified by the user)
   * extract signing secrets from github action variables 
   * build the project, sign the jar files, and stage them to the necessary locations
   * add the grails wrapper to the `grails-core` release
   * close the staging repository so the `grails-core` artifacts can be accessed
3. Create a matching release in `grails-forge`:
   * Follow the same steps to create a release in grails-forge. Update any release notes specific to the delegating cli & grails forge.
4. (grails-forge) The Github workflow `release.yml`, titled `Release - Create grails-forge`, will kick off.  This workflow will run a `publish` job that will complete similar steps to the `grails-core` publish job.
5. Kick off the `Release - Source Distribution` workflow from `release-source-distribution.yml` in `grails-core`. This job will: 
     * download the tagged grails source
     * download the tagged grails-forge source
     * generate a source distribution meeting the ASF requirements
     * upload the source distribution to the Github `grails-core` release
6. Kick off the `Release - Upload to dist.apache.org` workflow from `release-upload.yml` in `grails-core`. This job will:
     * update the KEYS file under https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/grails/KEYS with the version in the tagged source code
     * upload the source distribution to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails/VERSION/sources
     * upload the grails-wrapper binary distribution to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails/VERSION/distribution
     * upload the grails binary distribution to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails/VERSION/distribution (note: this is the sdkman artifact)

Once `grails-forge` & `grails-core` are published the end source & binary distributions should be staged. 

## 2. Verifying

Prior to releasing a vote, we need to verify the staged artifacts. Follow the below steps to verify each staged artifact.

### Source Distribution Verification
Download the zipped source distribution artifacts:
   * `apache-grails-<version>-incubating-src.zip` - the source distribution
   * `apache-grails-<version>-incubating-src.zip.asc` - the public key to verify the source distribution
   * `apache-grails-<version>-incubating-src.zip.sha512` - the checksum to verify the source distribution

from [https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails/version](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails)

Verify the source distribution checksum via the command:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 512 -c apache-grails-<version>-incubating-src.zip.sha512
   ```

Verify the source distribution signature via the command:
   ```bash
    gpg --verify apache-grails-<version>-incubating-src.zip.asc apache-grails-<version>-incubating-src.zip
   ```

Extract the zip file and verify the contents:
   * Ensure the `LICENSE` & `NOTICE` files are present to ensure license compliance.
   * Ensure `README.md` & `CONTRIBUTING.md` are present to ensure project build & usage instructions are present.
   * Ensure the `PUBLISHED` file is present so we know how to pull the various jar files.

### Jar file Signature Verification (Nexus Staging Repositories)
As part of uploading to repository.apache.org the signatures are verified to match a KEY that has been distributed.  It does not verify that the jar files are built with a key trusted by the Grails project.

Download the latest KEYS file and make sure it's imported into gpg:
```bash
    wget https://github.com/apache/grails-core/blob/7.0.x/KEYS
    gpg --import KEYS
```

The jar files will need downloaded and verified they were signed by a valid Grails key.  Run the script (substitute the staging repo name):  
```bash
    wget --recursive --no-parent --accept jar,asc https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachegrails-1020/org/apache/grails
    for jar_file in *.jar; do
      asc_file="${jar_file}.asc"
    
      if [[ -f "$asc_file" ]]; then
        echo "🔍 Verifying $jar_file..."
    
        gpg --verify "$asc_file" "$jar_file"
        verify_status=$?
    
        if [ $verify_status -eq 0 ]; then
          echo "✅ $jar_file is correctly signed."
        else
          echo "❌ $jar_file FAILED signature verification!"
        fi
    
        echo ""
      else
        echo "⚠️ No .asc file found for $jar_file. Skipping."
      fi
    done
```

### Reproducible Jar File
After all jar files are verified to be signed by a valid Grails key, we need to build a local copy to ensure the file was built with the right code base.

Bootstrap the source distribution so that it can be built: 
    ```bash
    gradle wrapper
    ```

Run the `verify-distribution.sh` shell script to compare the published jar files to a locally built version of them. For any differences, extract the jar files, use IntelliJ to compare each differing file. Assuming differences are ordering related, we can continue with the verification.

### Binary Distribution Verification
Download the binary distribution & expand it to test the various CLI's: `grailsw` (wrapper), `grails` (delegating), `grails-forge-cli`, and `grails-shell-cli`.  For each CLI, verify the published signature in the `PUBLISHED` file:
   ```bash
    gpg --verify <cli>.asc <cli>
   ```

### CLI Testing

Each CLI needs tested to ensure it's functional prior to release:

* testing `grailsw`:
    * set GRAILS_REPO_URL to the staging repository
    * run `grailsw` and ensure it downloads the correct jars to `.grails` (verify the checksums of the jars)
* testing `grails-shell-cli`:
    * create a basic app:
    ```bash
    grails-shell-cli create-app test
    ```
    * modify the application to include the staging repo
    * start the app:
    ```bash
    grails-shell-cli run-app
    ```
* Perform the same tests, but use the delegating cli `grails` with type forge
    * create a basic app:
    ```bash
    grails -t forge create-app test
    ```
    * modify the application to include the staging repo
    * start the app:
    ```bash
    gradlew bootRun
    ```

# Rollback

In the event a staged artifact needs rolled back, follow the below steps:

## Rollback Nexus Artifacts (Jars)

To remove a Nexus staging repo, run the workflow `Release - Drop Nexus Staging` in `grails-core`.  The input of this task can be obtained by logging into [repository.apache.org](https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories) and finding the staging repository name. Please note that there will always be 2 staging repositories for a Grails release because we keep `grails-forge` separate from `grails-core`.

## Rollback Distribution

To remove the staged distribution, use your SVN credentials to remove the version directory at [https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/grails)
